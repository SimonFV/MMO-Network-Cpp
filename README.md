# MMO-Network-Cpp
Network framework in C++ for client/server apps.
Implemented following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hNdkYInj4g&t=1794s) tutorial by [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) and adding some changes on my own.
The thread handling was implemented using the [mingw-std-threads](https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads) library.
